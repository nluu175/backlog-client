## User story

- As a user, I want to see all the games I have from my Steam Library
- As a user, I want to add notes to the games I have in my Library
- As a user, I want to look up games in my Library by name
- As a user, I want to import all the games I have from my Steam Library to my local library

## Todo:

## Next.JS Note

- Client vs. Server Component in NextJs
- Layout vs. Template

- Component Hierarchy

  > - Layout > Template > ErrorBoundary(Error) > Suspense > ErrorBoundary(NotFound) > Page

- Recovering from Errors

- Error.tsx will not handle errors occur in the layout.tsx file

- Pallarel Route: Slots in next.js (@folder). This is the way to render one or more pages within the same layout.

- Default page on unmatched routes
